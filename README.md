Background:
We talked about decision trees last week. Decision trees are meant to allow the player a choice and predict the outcome from these choices. Modern day video games especially narrative based games usually always contain decision trees that the player may not even be aware of. 

Decision Tree with If Else:
In programing, there are if-else statements that analyze a current condition, and perform certain actions based on that condition. Each decision in a decision tree is like an if-else statement in code. For example, a pong decision tree could look a little like this in code:

Instructions:
1. Fork and clone this remote repository to create a development environment on your computer
2. Think of any game you want and think of how you could make a simplified decision tree for three NPCs in the game. It's highly recommended to draw it out on a piece of paper first.
3. Fill out the code template I give you within your working directory. It won't actually run, we will worry about that next week. 
4. Use the correct git command to move your changes from the working directory to the staging area. 
5. Use the correct git command to commit the changes WITH a message about which game and characters you chose.
6. Use the correct git command to push your commit to the remote repository. 
7. Create a pull request for your commit. 

Hint: Use the cheat sheet found in files on canvas to help.
